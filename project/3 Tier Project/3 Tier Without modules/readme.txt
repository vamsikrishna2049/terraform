Challenges:
security group dependency cycle. This cycle arises because each security group references other security groups in its inbound rules, 
creating a circular dependency.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:
1. WebSG: The WebSG allows traffic from the DB_SG.
2. DB_SG: The DB_SG allows traffic from the AppSG and BastionHostSG.
3. AppSG: The AppSG allows traffic from the WebSG and BastionHostSG.
4. BastionHostSG: The BastionHostSG allows traffic from the DB_SG.

Solution:
---------
Using null_resource we can work on this

How null_resource Helps:
A null_resource is a special resource type in Terraform that doesn't perform any actions but can manage dependencies. 
By introducing a null_resource with triggers referencing the IDs of resources involved in the dependency, you force Terraform to wait -
 for all those resources to be created before applying the rules.

Example with null_resource:
Here's the code snippet from the previous response demonstrating how null_resource addresses the cyclical dependency:

Terraform
resource "null_resource" "security_group_dependency" {
  triggers = {
    app_security_group_rule = aws_security_group_rule.app_to_bastian.id
    bastion_host_security_group_rule = aws_security_group_rule.bastion_to_app.id
  }
}

In this example:
The null_resource named security_group_dependency is defined.
The triggers block specifies two dependencies:
app_security_group_rule: This refers to the ID of the aws_security_group_rule named app_to_bastian.
bastion_host_security_group_rule: This refers to the ID of the aws_security_group_rule named bastion_to_app.
By referencing these IDs in the triggers, Terraform ensures that the security group rules (app_to_bastian and bastion_to_app) are created before attempting to apply them to the security groups (which might reference each other). This breaks the cyclical dependency and allows Terraform to apply the configuration successfully.

Alternative Solutions:
There are other ways to address cyclical dependencies in Terraform security groups, but the null_resource approach is a common and straightforward method. 

Here are some alternatives:
Reordering resources: If possible, rearrange your security group definitions to create them in an order that avoids the dependency issue.
Using depends_on: You can use the depends_on meta-argument on resources to explicitly specify dependencies.
However, the null_resource approach is often preferred for its simplicity and flexibility when dealing with complex dependencies.
