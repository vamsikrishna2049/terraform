Project Title: 
Highly Available Web Application on AWS

Abstract: 
This project outlines the design and implementation of a highly available web application architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
The architecture utilizes various AWS services to ensure fault tolerance and redundancy, guaranteeing continuous application uptime and data integrity.

Key components:
1. Route 53: Manages the domain name resolution and directs traffic to the application.
2. Amazon CloudFront: Distributes static content from edge locations around the world for improved performance and reduced latency.
3. Elastic Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances for scalability and availability.
4. Amazon EC2 Instances: Run the web application in an Auto Scaling Group configuration, automatically scaling up or down based on traffic demand.
5. Amazon RDS: Hosts the application database in a multi-AZ deployment with a primary and standby instance for disaster recovery.
6. Amazon S3: Stores static content and logs.

Benefits:
1. High availability: The architecture ensures application uptime even if individual components fail.
2. Scalability: The infrastructure automatically scales to accommodate changing traffic demands.
3. Fault tolerance: Redundancy in key components ensures data integrity and application resilience.
4. Performance: CloudFront delivers static content from edge locations for fast loading times.
